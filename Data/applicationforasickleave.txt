Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next [number of days] days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will do my best to make up for any missed work upon my return. I will be monitoring my email intermittently during my leave and will respond to any urgent messages as soon as I am able.

Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to returning to work as soon as I am feeling better.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
